A Guide to Lake Vaelia, by Arno Rengal

Dwindling Heights Keep

Located on the eastern shore of Lake Vaelia, the keep at Duinlan Heights has stood for centuries. Originally built for some long forgotten purpose, it played an invaluable role in turning back the full might of the Ferrets of Saltar.

It is now occupied by a small garrison of the Baron's Rat Guard.

Though once a fine building, the keep has long since fallen into disrepair; its main enemy no longer marauding ferrets, but instead the acidic waters of the lake, which are slowly eroding the cliff face upon which the fortress stands.

It's for this reason that, among the locals, the fortress has become known as Dwindling Heights Keep. Like the building itself, the soldiers, too, have seen better days.

Dwindling Heights is the last and final post for members of the Rat Guard who have displeased the Baron in some way or another, and considered quite literally to be a dead-end job.
