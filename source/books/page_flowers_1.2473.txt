You stood before the Baron, your wife Merra at your side. He bid you play 'The Poisoned Cup', and you knew then this was not for his amusement, but a test. And so play you did. But from Merra there was only silence, and a look of such defiance.
He moved to strike her, the Baron, and you cried out and went to her... and then, darkness. How many days have passed since then? In your heart you know she's still alive, and that you'll one day find her. Until then all you have are these flowers, your memories of her, and a question ~ why?
