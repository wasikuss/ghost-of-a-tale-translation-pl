Too many fell here in the clarion's defence, the names of all but nine forever lost to memory, death, and time. 
By those nine names may the sacrifices of all be known, and let these candles burn eternal in their stead.
And should some ill wind snuff them out, may it be upon the conscience of all good creatures to see these candles lit once more in the solemn order that our nine heroes fell.

<b>Jothe</b> fell first, here, at the forest's gate. Then did <b>Oulle</b>, the archer, looking north toward his home.
<b>Hythe</b> was taken next, before <b>Canlunn</b>, southwest of the clarion, fell.

<b>....</b> was lost on the northern slopes, Beneath the bridge, in the shade of her beloved oak tree. 
<b>H......</b> fell in sight of Vaelia's Plain, and the light of the setting sun.
The two sisters fought and died together, <b>Wende</b> first, beneath the arches, and <b>.....</b> just below her.
<b>.........</b> went alone, the last before the clarion's call.
