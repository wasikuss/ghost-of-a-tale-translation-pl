Had it really been three whole years since Master Lewlin left? You'd worked hard, and learned so much since then ~ how to read the land, the winds, and the changing seasons, learning the uses for each crop ~ for food, for dyes, and fabrics. 
And then to you and Merra came a child ~ just one ~ rare for Mice, and so thought of as a blessing. You named him Brin, the Mouse word for 'seed'. The minstrel's life seemed so distant then, and you were happy.
