<page>
<b>Ear~Cap</b>
A broad green cap and orange stem distinguish this handsome mushroom.
<i>The Ear~Cap flourishes on dead and rotting wood ~ the trunks of fallen trees, their stumps, and so on.</i>
Used in treatments for:
~Fog~eye
~Stomach murmurs
~Doubt
<page>
<b>Cat's Tooth</b>
A rare mushroom, yellow in colour and fluted in design. Its colloquial name is derived from this distinctive shape.
<i>The Cat's Tooth may be found growing on or near rough~hewn stonework ~ walls, archways, et cetera.</i> 
Used in treatments for:
~Droop ear
~Toothache
<page>
<b>Spongeball</b>
Amateur mycologists might initially have some difficulty identifying this specimen. Indeed its red cap, accented in white, does nothing to evoke the imagery of its name. In fact, the Spongeball's name is derived from the large white spores it releases towards the summer's end.
<i>The Spongeball abounds around old cut stone steps, flagstones, and the like.</i> 
Used in treatments for:
~Saltar poisoning
<page>
<b>Weeping Widow</b>
The purple cap should serve as a warning to all that this highly toxic mushroom should not be consumed. And yet it holds some mysterious allure for drunken bucks, perhaps taking a shortcut home from the local inn through this glade, or that dale. This specimen has truly earned its name.
<i>The Weeping Widow blooms beneath bee nests, where natural sugars from the honeycomb infuse the ground.</i>
Used in treatments for:
~Marital bliss
~Pus~in~boots
<page>
<b>Loggerhead</b>
This specimen has a curious effect upon any who consume its flesh. The victim will quickly become argumentative and belligerent, attempting to fight any creature that might try and come to their aid.
<i>The Loggerhead thrives all along cliff edges.</i>
Used in treatments for:
~Cowardice
~Croup
<page>
<b>Doggerel</b>
An unremarkable mushroom at first glance, the Doggerel nevertheless possesses many properties of interest to the apothecarist.
<i>The Doggerel endures in places never touched by the sun.</i>
Used in treatments for:
~A roving eye
~A fickle heart
~Typhus
<page>
<b>Milky Cap</b>
The flesh of this specimen is extremely poisonous, but when pressed and filtered it produces a tasty fluid, often used in the production of various cheeses.
<i>The Milky Cap grows predominantly around graves.</i>
Used in treatments for:
~Pawpox
~Vaelian Fever
<page>
<b>Noggintop</b>
The Noggintop, with its texture reminiscent of a rodent's brain, is perhaps the most alluring of all mushrooms.
<i>These mushrooms grow in abundance on the ground surrounding tree stumps.</i>
Used in treatments for:
~Shyness
~Moor Sickness

<i>This fungus ~ the Moonlight's Veld ~ is commonly found growing beneath oak trees.</i>
Used in treatments for:

<page>
<b>Midnight Brood</b>
This specimen blooms only at night. Its dark cap and stem make the Midnight Brood especially challenging to collect.
<i>The Midnight Brood favours the acidic soils found under and around thorn bushes.</i>
Used in treatments for:
~Lung Rattle
~Tattletail
<page>
<b>Nightrush</b>
As its name suggests, the Nightrush only blooms during the hours of darkness.
<i>The Nightrush grows exclusively around the trunks of fallen trees.</i>
Used in treatments for:
~Frog Breath
~Dizziness
~Recurring dreams
<page>
<b>Mooncrest</b>
These Mooncrest and Nightrush share a genus, and superficially appear to be much alike. However, the Mooncrest is far rarer, and greatly desired for its healing properties.
<i>The Mooncrest prefers the warmth of fires ~ braziers, torches and so forth.</i>
Used in treatments for:
~Envy
~Insomnia
~Loose Tongue
