The spider was already dead when you reached the high meadow, Merra's hatchet sticking from its eye. Brin was crying, more startled by his mother's scream than by the spider's bite. He was deathly quiet now, laid over your shoulder as you hurried through the snow, Merra close behind.
Ahead, barely visible through the squall, you could just make out the Tern Road checkpoint. Just beyond lay the torches of the mine, and the healer who might save your child.
