A portly barrel of a Rat with an infamously short fuse, Captain Otto Powderkeg was captain of the galleon 'Lake Witch'. He is perhaps the most renowned pirate ever to sail Lake Vaelia.

<b>In his 'WANTED' posters Captain Powderkeg is always seen wearing:</b> 

<i>Pirate captain's hat
Eyepatch
Baldric with buckle/ruff
Silk sash
Grey buccaneer's boots</i>
