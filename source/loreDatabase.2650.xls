    <Cell ss:StyleID="s71"><Data ss:Type="String">The Badgers of Baladhon are the great seafaring culture of the northern seas. Records of their voyages date back almost five thousand years, and their myths even further. The oldest tells of Baladhon's discovery by the first of the badgers, who drifted down from the heavens on the trunk of a fallen tree. Yet their exploration is driven not by the desire to conquer, but by their natural curiosity, their appetite, and an instinct for foraging.&#10;Baladhon is densely forested, and the Badgers are renowned for their skill in carpentry. The Sylabub tree, which grows in great numbers along the coast of Baladhon, possesses a natural resistance to the corrosive powers of seawater, and ships built from their timber are in high demand.&#10;Indeed, many of the Red Paw's finest vessels began their lives in the forests and shipyards of Baladhon, before being hauled some 800 miles across the northern Rat lands, to languish in the erosive waters of Lake Vaelia.</Data></Cell>

Songs of his exploits during the invasion have done much to bolster his renown.&#10;Born in Muridea, the baron has historically been broadly sympathetic to the plight of the Mouse population, and an advocate of increased autonomy for the region. However, following recent unrest in northern Muridea, Osdrik was summoned to the capital for an emergency meeting of the five barons of the Red Paw.  Under pressure to suppress dissent and restore order, Osdrik's guards began efforts to identify and arrest prominent figures in the emerging Muridean separatist movement, known as 'The Sons of Asper'.</Data></Cell>

Some say the admirably restrained Knights lost their temper when the Saltarian emissary was stricken with an uncontrollable fit of laughter as the Threeve elder was seized by a salvo of sneezes, caused by the fine-grained sand for which Lye is renowned.&#10;Alas the truth might never be known, as in a rare breach of guild etiquette the minstrels on both sides dropped their instruments to join the fray, leading to wildly diverging accounts of the battle.&#10;</Data></Cell>

His courage inspired eleven comrades to join the fray. Among them was Duinlan of Dhall, astride his golden salamander.

    <Cell ss:StyleID="s71"><Data ss:Type="String">Faced with the prospect of invasion Rodrik, the last Rat king, abandoned his crown and fled as his kingdom descended into chaos. In the king's absence the five Rat barons, led by Osdrik, united their forces and drove back the Saltarian warships. &#10;But there was no heir to the throne, and none could be crowned king anew, for the Stone of Ascension had been lost in the shipwreck that also claimed Rodrik's life. And so the barons assembled an emergency ruling council, moving quickly to restore order to the kingdom of the Rats, and the annexed lands of Muridea. &#10;Unrest was quelled with ruthless and bloody efficiency. The council's emblem&#45;-a circle surrounded by five crimson strokes&#45;-was intended to represent the five barons sitting in congress. But in the minds of many it resembled nothing less than a bloody footprint&#45;-the age of the Red Paw had begun...</Data></Cell>

Goods unloaded there are taken on by caravan cross land to Dhall. Scarn is the largest of the five ports adorning the shores of Lake Vaelia; Orandas to the northeast is a mere mooring post by comparison. A bustling and vibrant trading centre, Scarn is mostly populated by Rodents and operates under the management of the Red Paw. It is nevertheless a fine example of a diversity of creatures working in harmony, and only rarely descends into sheer chaos when the Merchants Guild goes on strike.

But his most famous deed is, to many, also his most noble.&#10;It’s said that Tulong once risked his own life to warn a small village of the approach of marauding bandits, giving the mud farmers living there just time enough to flee. They returned to find their homes intact but ransacked, their valuables gone. Still, the villagers were grateful to have kept their heads, and organized a banquet in Tulong’s honour, proving that mud farmers are generous, if often terribly naive.</Data></Cell>
