Come hear of Rodrik the First, the famous Coward King!
[00:07:64]
When all the way from Saltar's mines the Ferrets came a-charging
[00:15:24]
He cowered up to the highest tower as the warning bells a-tolled!
[00:22:81]
The glove was thrown, the moment come to show his true mettle
[00:30:41]
But yellow as brass was the coward king, and never quite as bold
[00:37:96]
On trembling shanks and soggy tail he set sail quite unsettled!
[00:45:57]
His subjects cried and called to him, but he left them to their sorrow
[00:53:11]
Until his ship was sunk as stone... and he cowered down below
[01:03:50]
