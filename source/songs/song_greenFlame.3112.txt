In the beginning was the Green Flame
A force without conscience consuming all in its path
The creatures of the world fought back, but one by one they fell
Only to rise again as puppets of the emerald fire
It was the Rats alone who stood and fought
Until at last, at Periclave, the Green Flame was extinguished
