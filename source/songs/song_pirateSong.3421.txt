[00:01:14]
The waves may crash, the ship may sink
[00:04:01]
And every one of us might drown
[00:07:89]
But pirates call the sea 'the drink'
[00:10:56]
So raise a glass as we go down
[00:13:54]
With sundercrabs we'll have a tipple
[00:17:10]
And steal the Fish King's pearly cup
[00:22:65]
With shapely Mer-Mice, wet our whistle
[00:25:35]
Til top is down, and bottom's up!
[00:29:50]
