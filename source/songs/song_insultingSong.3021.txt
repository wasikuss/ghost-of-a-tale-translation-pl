[00:07:32]
I've found the true nature of creatures is shown
[00:12:23]
In the names by which each is collectively known
[00:16:30]
I've heard Tidings of Magpies and seen Murders of Crows
[00:21:26]
Smelled a Surfeit of Skunks with a peg on my nose
[00:29:86]
Met a Mischief of Mice, who were masters of prose
[00:34:74]
And a Sneaking of Weasels, who were light on their toes
[00:39:24]
But the Rats are the worst, as well everyone knows
[00:43:73]
'Cause a gathering of Rats is a Plague, as it goes!
[00:48:26]
And now that's off my chest I have this to propose
[00:52:70]
That they're creatures of whom I suggest we dispose!
