May I present to you the greatest of crooks
[00:04:36]
But you'll never have read about them in your books
[00:08:05]
Brother and sister, they're siblings in crime
[00:11:20]
But they've never been caught and they've never done time
[00:14:73]
Fatale is wily, and brave to the end
[00:18:27]
But she's not someone on whom you'd ever depend!
[00:21:63]
If Fatale's the brains Gusto's surely the muscle
[00:25:18]
They know how to rob and they know how to hustle
[00:28:37] 
At thieving and stealing and crime they're the best
[00:31:85]
You want to try outsmarting them? Be my guest!
[00:35:22]
Now please check your pockets, 'cause for our finale
[00:38:77] 
You've all been robbed blind by Gusto and Fatale!
