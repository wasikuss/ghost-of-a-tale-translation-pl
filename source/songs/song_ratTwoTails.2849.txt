[00:00:00]
An Imperial Galleon set course for Jaccourd
[00:02:68]
With Queen Arianne of the Badgers aboard
[00:05:48]
When two days from port in a terrible storm
[00:08:40]
Its mast broke in half and the mizzen was torn
[00:11:38]
But the vessel was saved by the Rat with Two Tails 
[00:16:76] 
Who stopped them from running aground on the shales
[00:19:55]
By hoisting her majesty's knickers for sails!
[00:23:50]
The Rat with Two Tails, oh! The Rat with Two Tails
[00:26:24]
He saved Arianne from those terrible gales
[00:29:25]
He may not be a badger, but he's certainly male
[00:32:24]
And she'd not known true love 'til the Rat with Two Tails!
